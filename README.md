projects in deep learning

1) digits_hand_signs_CNN_from_scratch - > The data set is of images from coursera, with hand signals to show digits.

CNN forward and backward propagation is developed from scratch. (using Numoy ad Pandas)

The same data set is also used to implement CNN in tensorflow

2) MNIST_handwrittendigits_Neural Networks -> MNIST handwritten digit data set
      a)  Neural Networks built from scratch using Numpy and Pandas
      b) The same data set is also used to predict digits using tensorflow neural networks.

3) Emotion Recognition -> CKplus data set is used to detect emotions from facial expressions.
